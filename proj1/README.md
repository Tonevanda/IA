## Rules

- [ ] Two to four players move stacks of one to five pieces around a checkerboard with the corners cut out.
- [ ] Stacks may move as many spaces as there are pieces in the stack. 
- [ ] Players may only move a stack if the topmost piece in the stack is one of their pieces. 
- [ ] When a stack lands on another stack, the two stacks merge; if the new stack contains more than five pieces, then pieces are removed from the bottom to bring it down to five. 
- [ ] If a player's own piece is removed, they are kept and may be placed on the board later in lieu of moving a stack. If an opponent's piece is removed, it is captured. The last player who is able to move a stack wins.
